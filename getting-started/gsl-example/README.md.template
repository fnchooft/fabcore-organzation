# Generator Scripting Language - teaching Gemini

During a recent course AI was explained and someone mentioned that
Gemini performs better then DeepSeek and ChatGPT in coding tasks.

So I took that opertunity to:

1. Teach Gemini about GSL ( www.github.com/zeromq/gsl)
2. Provide the README.txt file as context
3. Explain what I wanted.

## The assignment

I want to teach you about GSL, more context is provided here: [README.txt](https://github.com/zeromq/gsl/blob/master/README.txt).

Ask: Write an entities.xml file which contains some entities with typical fields such as name,age etc.

Gemini produced: 

### entities.xml

```xml
{% include "entities.xml" %}
```

After this I requested it to write the gsl-template to generate, on the basis of the entity-format C-structs.

### entity_generator.gsl
The resulting template after some back and forth looks like this:

{% include "entity_generator.gsl" language="c" %}

I then asked it to generate a main.c file and a Makefile in order to compile the entire example:

### main.c

```c
{% include "main.c" %}
```

### Makefile

```Makefile
{% include "Makefile" %}
```


## Generated artifacts

As this should be a generic entity-generator, this first template generates C-code.
This might not be the cleanest code, however a 'seasoned' C-developer would be able
to provide a working version, which contains best practices for memory-management etc.

This working example could easily be taking by AI or a Human/AI - Centaur to generate
templates for other languages.

So, here come the generated artifiacts.

### Person.h

{% code title="Person.h" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" lanaguage="c" %}
include({{Person.h}})
{% endcode %}


### Person.c

{% code title="Person.c" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" lanaguage="c" %}
include({{Person.c}})
{% endcode %}
