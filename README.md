# Welcome to my musing's page

On this page I keep things such as Proof-of-Concepts and Insights as we attempt to continue the perilous journey of software design. And mind you with the AI-hype upon us, many things will be tried to get a feel for and an understandig of the limits.

I most like to take things which I am wondering about and play with them, these findings either end up in a folder on one of the many machines I have, but recently I have started to do things such a T.I.L ( Things In Learned - one such example of this can be found here ( [https://github.com/fnchooft/TIL](https://github.com/fnchooft/TIL) ).



Also we are trying to use GitBook for some of our Projects at work - and you cannot implement what you do not understand, so here we go this page uses GitBook and will contain many small PoC's.
